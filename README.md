BTCBank is committed to creating an autonomous, efficient and transparent digital asset trading platform that allows traders and investors to confidently trade on any size without worrying about the fairness and transparency of the platform and the reliability of data security and privacy protection.



At the same time, BTCBank is not a traditional company, it has taken a key step in the evolution of the digital asset trading platform to the community. The BTCBank community is an open and transparent Token-based organization, and BTCBank Token (BT) represents all interests in the BTCBank trading platform. With the “transaction-mining” model, more than half of BT will be rewarded to community users through fee-based mining.



The BTCBank community will allocate 100% of the fee and 70% of the income to the BT holders and will destroy BT regularly. We will allocate this amount of income in equal proportions according to the composition of income. For example, suppose that in a certain allocation period, the BTCBank's to-be-distributed income is 100 BTC, and a user A holds BT, which accounts for 1% of the total circulation. In this period, the income received by the user A is 1 BTC.



In addition, each BT holder has the right to participate in community business decisions, team elections and other community activities. BTCBank is a community-based organization that is shared, shared, and shared by all BT holders.
